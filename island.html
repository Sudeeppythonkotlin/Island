      <p>Hello would you like to learn for free? If you like we are
      here to help you. Island is a start-up founded to provide free 
education for everyone who want to learn without any bias.
There are many educational apps available out there, they charge 
subscrption charges which everyone cannot afford. But we have
a mission to provide free education for all and we will also provide 
the unemployed teachers a oppurtunity for earning a large sum of 
money without collecting money from students. We are shortly developing
our start-up and we will provide more videos for free. we dont have large
team so there will be some delay but will try our level best to improve
our website. We will be very glad if you share this website with 
your friends. Thank You✌
